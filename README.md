Social Sign
=========
Built at the PennApps Spring 2013 hackathon, Social Sign is a friendly tool for learning sign language! By using the Leap Motion, the BadApples team implemented a rudimentary machine learning algorithm to track and identify American Sign Language from a user's hand gestures. Social Sign visualizes these hand gestures and broadcasts them in a textual and visual representation to other signers in the signing room. 

In a standard chat room fashion, the interface permits written communication but with the benefit of enhanced learning in mind. It's all about learning a new way to communicate. SocialSign- handing communication to you. 


Built using Node, MongoDB, Socket.io, Three.js, WebGL.
